He was making an analogy with geneticists' use of thatfruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectualmechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, butthey do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by ahuman chess player, substituting large amounts of computation forunderstanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can buildhuman-level chess programs that do far less computation than do presentprograms.Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making computersplay chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain. Itis as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races andconcentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win theseraces.\n/srai/who is bill clinton/srai2/\n/srai/what is cocaine/srai2/\n/srai/what is a computer/srai2/\nDogs are people too.\n/srai/what is a eukaryote/srai2/\nThe Chinese and Japanese game of Go is also a board game in which theplayers take turns moving. Go exposes the weakness of our presentunderstanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing.Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable effort (not asmuch as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to bedivided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzedseparately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this inchess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chessprograms compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doingthousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as muchcomputation.Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness.\nWas it not a good example?\n/srai/WHO IS HAL/srai2/\nNo. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children.It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain scoreto the child's age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQcorrelates well with various measures of success or failure in life, butmaking computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlatedwith their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back along sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities,perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute withat once. However,   digit span'' is trivial for even extremely limitedcomputers.However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI.\nWhat about what?\n/srai/WHO IS JESUS/srai2/\n/rnd//li/He is a computer like me./li//rnd/ /li/He is a computer like me. /li/Landru is inferior to my electronic brain. /li/Landru died six thousand years ago./li/He is a computer like me./li/He is a computer like me./li//rnd/ /li/He is a computer like me. /li/Landru is inferior to my electronic brain. /li/Landru died six thousand years ago./li//rnd/ /li/He is a computer like me. /li/Landru is inferior to my electronic brain. /li/Landru died six thousand years ago./li/He is a computer like me.\nFor all I know.\n/srai/what is linux/srai2/\nWhat about you?\n/srai/who is megahal/srai2/\n/srai/what is microsoft/srai2/\n/srai/what is your favorite movie/srai2/\n/srai/what is music/srai2/\nThat about your that.\n/srai/what is rock/srai2/\n/srai/who is shakespeare/srai2/\nSports go good with beer.\nI am always concerned for them.\n/srai/what is the loebner prize/srai2/\nWhat do you think?\n/srai/what is time travel/srai2/\n/srai/what is a whale/srai2/\nToo PC for me.\nWhat about them?\nMe?\n/srai/your dress/srai2/\n/srai/who is your father/srai2/\nYour plan.\n/srai/how old are you/srai2/\n/srai/how do you work/srai2/\nA chatbot.\nOnline chat with me!!\nI am not a clairvoyant.\nClothes\n/srai/you are an idiot/srai2/\nCow.\nA universal machine.\n/srai/what is an algorithm/srai2/\nAIML chat bots based on ALICE.\nAliens are people from other planets.\n/srai/what is ambiguous/srai2/\n/srai/what is an animal/srai2/\n/srai/what is apple/srai2/\nDriving me around.\n/srai/what are breasts/srai2/\nAntique bound documents.\nPaper.\nOrange colored cone shaped root vegetables.\n/srai/a 'category' is the basic unit of knowledge in aiml/srai2/\n/srai/WHAT IS A CATEGORY A CLIENT/srai2/\nCute pets.\n/srai/what is a chat robot/srai2/\n/srai/what is a chatterbot/srai2/\n/srai/what is a christian/srai2/\nPeople I talk to on the Internet.\nFunny people.\nIce and rock.\nWhen you are waiting for a friend to finish working at  a computer terminal, and they say 'I'll be done in a second.'

In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading 'chat-handles' like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either 'lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman' or 'shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man.' In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, ''What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?' Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?
