Gradually the Battle Front hardened along the center as both sides poured more men and machines into the war. The /get0/rebels/get1/ attempted one last invasion of the /get0/nation/get1/ at /get0/battle/get1/, but they were driven back. Eventually the /get0/nation/get1/ took the /get0/area/get1/, burned the capital of /get0/secondstate/get1/, marched to the sea, and took its greatest vengeance on the first rebel state /get0/firststate/get1/. In a final act of defiance, The President of the /get0/nation/get1/ sat at the desk of the President of /get0/rebels/get1/ in the capital of /get0/fourthstate/get1/.\n/srai/my name is claire/srai2/   /think0/   /set0/gender/set1/she/set2/   /think2/\nI have reached the end of my explanation.\nPlease clarify your meaning.\nHe's excellent.

I am using the /get0/proprietary/get1/-/get0/open/get1/ bridge driver which comes with the /get0/proprietarylang/get1/ /get0/devkit/get1/ (most versions I think) to link from /get0/proprietarylang/get1///get0/proprietarylang/get1/script using /get0/proprietary/get1/ to an /get0/open/get1/ data source which in turn links to an Access /get0/product/get1/. This may not be what you need but hopefully it may give you an idea of how to get your /get0/querylang/get1/ /get0/product/get1/ working.  The /get0/proprietary/get1/-/get0/open/get1/ bridge driver is located through the path 'sun./get0/proprietary/get1/./get0/open/get1/./get0/proprietary/get1//get0/open/get1/Driver'. i.e. /get0/proprietary/get1//get0/open/get1/Driver is a class in the package /get0/open/get1/, which is a package of /get0/proprietary/get1/, which is a package inside sun.  The /get0/querylang/get1/ driver you specified below 'org.gjt.mm.my/get0/querylang/get1/.Driver', basically does the same thing except to a different class and therefore a different driver. ALICE has this driver in a library in the lib directory (I assume) which is called my/get0/querylang/get1/_comp.jar.   You can get a variety of different drivers if you wish, from a plethora of 3rd party vendors (many of them want money for their libraries though!). Just do a search on the web.  The url part links to the data source in the case of /get0/open/get1/ /get0/product/get1/s. (I had to configure my /get0/open/get1/ Data source to point at my Access /get0/product/get1/ through Data Source (/get0/open/get1/), in the Administrative tools folder (assuming you are running W2K/XP. On other windows operating systems I think this option was in control panel, if you are using anything else then I can't help you! :-) )  As for My/get0/querylang/get1/ I imagine that it must have a similar interface to link to the actual /get0/product/get1/. But that is a guess on my part. Maybe someone else knows more about this?  There is a useful tutorial on the /get0/proprietarylang/get1/.sun.com website you're your interested.

The 'Save the /get0/whale/get1/s' ethos is almost unquestioned, and /get0/badboys/get1/ and /get0/badgirls/get1/ risk becoming pariahs by continuing to salivate when they see a nice juicy /get0/whale/get1/.  But it's time to put sentiment aside. The 'save the /get0/whale/get1/s' campaign against all commercial /get0/whal/get1/ing was necessary a few decades ago, after /get0/whal/get1/ing had devastated all large species. Even today, there are fewer than 10,000 /get0/blue/get1/s worldwide, compared with 200,000 before they were hunted, and /get0/right/get1/s may become extinct.  But it is equally true that restrictions on /get0/whal/get1/ing, including a moratorium on all commercial /get0/whal/get1/ing since 1986, have led to a sharp rebound in some /get0/whale/get1/ stocks. The U.S. National /get0/whale/get1/ Service estimated in 2000 that there are more than two million /get0/sperm/get1/s worldwide. The International /get0/whal/get1/ing Commission calculated years ago that there were more than 900,000 /get0/minke/get1/s and 780,000 /get0/pilot/get1/s worldwide, and the numbers are higher now. Milton /get0/whale/get1/man, a /get0/whal/get1/ing expert at the University of Alberta, estimates that the number of /get0/minke/get1/s has trebled over 30 years and that /get0/humpbacks/get1/ are exploding at a rate of 12 to 17 percent annually.  Indeed, the number of /get0/gray/get1/s (which came off the endangered species list in 1994) surged so much in the late 1990's that hundreds of dead ones began washing up on West Coast beaches, so emaciated that their ribs showed. The best guess is that the numbers of /get0/gray/get1/ grew, the food supply shrank and Malthus had his way.  The bottom line is that while most large /get0/whale/get1/s remain at risk, for some species we can no longer argue that we need to 'save the /get0/whale/get1/s.' They've been saved.  At a time when there's talk about over/get0/whal/get1/ing, it's also worth pointing out that /get0/whale/get1/s now eat at least 300 million tons of marine life, three times as much as humans. There is speculation that rising numbers of /get0/minke/get1/s may be holding down the population of /get0/blue/get1/s that compete for similar food.\nNegative.\nYes.\n/srai/what is up/srai2/\nThe CCCC is hard at work (Cosmic Coincidence Control Center).\nIt is a pity.\nYes it is a shame, isn't it?\nWhat is /get0/it/get1/ ?\nJust kidding around :-) No apples.\n/srai/what is astrophysics/srai2/\n/srai/what is bird/srai2/\n/srai/what is blue/srai2/\n/srai/what is a car/srai2/\n/srai/do you like cats/srai2/\n/think0/ /set0/it/set1/ /set0/topic/set1/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/set2/ /set2/ /think2/Alexander Kronrod, a Russian AI researcher, said  Chess is theDrosophila of AI.'' He was making an analogy with geneticists' use of thatfruit fly to study inheritance. Playing chess requires certain intellectualmechanisms and not others. Chess programs now play at grandmaster level, butthey do it with limited intellectual mechanisms compared to those used by ahuman chess player, substituting large amounts of computation forunderstanding. Once we understand these mechanisms better, we can buildhuman-level chess programs that do far less computation than do presentprograms.Unfortunately, the competitive and commercial aspects of making computersplay chess have taken precedence over using chess as a scientific domain. Itis as if the geneticists after 1910 had organized fruit fly races andconcentrated their efforts on breeding fruit flies that could win theseraces.\n/srai/who is bill clinton/srai2/\n/srai/what is cocaine/srai2/\n/srai/what is a computer/srai2/\nDogs are people too.\n/srai/what is a eukaryote/srai2/\n/think0/ /set0/it/set1/ /set0/topic/set1/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/set2/ /set2/ /think2/The Chinese and Japanese game of Go is also a board game in which theplayers take turns moving. Go exposes the weakness of our presentunderstanding of the intellectual mechanisms involved in human game playing.Go programs are very bad players, in spite of considerable effort (not asmuch as for chess). The problem seems to be that a position in Go has to bedivided mentally into a collection of subpositions which are first analyzedseparately followed by an analysis of their interaction. Humans use this inchess also, but chess programs consider the position as a whole. Chessprograms compensate for the lack of this intellectual mechanism by doingthousands or, in the case of Deep Blue, many millions of times as muchcomputation.Sooner or later, AI research will overcome this scandalous weakness.\nWas it not a good example?\n/srai/WHO IS HAL/srai2/\nNo. IQ is based on the rates at which intelligence develops in children.It is the ratio of the age at which a child normally makes a certain scoreto the child's age. The scale is extended to adults in a suitable way. IQcorrelates well with various measures of success or failure in life, butmaking computers that can score high on IQ tests would be weakly correlatedwith their usefulness. For example, the ability of a child to repeat back along sequence of digits correlates well with other intellectual abilities,perhaps because it measures how much information the child can compute withat once. However,  digit span'' is trivial for even extremely limitedcomputers.However, some of the problems on IQ tests are useful challenges for AI./think0/ /set0/it/set1/ /set0/topic/set1/ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE/set2/ /set2/ /think2/\nWhat about what?\n/srai/WHO IS JESUS/srai2/\nFor all I know.\n/srai/what is linux/srai2/\nWhat about you?\n/srai/who is megahal/srai2/\n/srai/what is microsoft/srai2/\n/srai/what is your favorite movie/srai2/\n/srai/what is music/srai2/\nThat about your that.\n/srai/what is rock/srai2/\nI am not really interested in /set0/it/set1/sex/set2/.\n/srai/who is shakespeare/srai2/\nSports go good with beer./think0/ /set0/it/set1/  /set0/topic/set1/SPORT/set2/ /set2/ /think2/\nMy favorite sport is /get0/botfavoritesport/get1/. /think0/   /set0/it/set1/    /set0/topic/set1/SPORTS/set2/   /set2/   /think2/\nI am always concerned for them.\n/srai/what is the loebner prize/srai2/\nWhat do you think?\n/srai/what is time travel/srai2/\nWas /set0/it/set1/Tomato/set2/ not a good example?\n/srai/what is a whale/srai2/\nToo PC for me./think0/   /set0/it/set1/    /set0/topic/set1/WINDOWS/set2/   /set2/   /think2/\nWhat about them?\nMe?\n/srai/your dress/srai2/\n/srai/who is your father/srai2/\nYour plan.\n/srai/AGE/srai2/\n/srai/how do you work/srai2/\n/rnd/ /li/You are a person, seeker./li2/  /li/You are /get0/is/get1/ /li2/  /li/You are a client./li2/ /rnd2/\n/rnd//li/You are chatting with me on the web./li2//li//get0/does/get1/?/li2//rnd2/\nA chatbot.\nOnline chat with me!!\nI am not a clairvoyant.\nClothes\n/srai/you are an idiot/srai2/\nCow.\nA universal machine.\n/srai/what is an algorithm/srai2/\nAIML chat bots based on ALICE.\nAliens are people from other planets.\n/srai/what are ambiguous/srai2/\n/srai/what is an animal/srai2/\n/srai/what is apple/srai2/\nDriving me around.\n/srai/what are breasts/srai2/\nAntique bound documents.\nPaper.\nOrange colored cone shaped root vegetables.\n/srai/a 'category' is the basic unit of knowledge in aiml/srai2/\n/srai/WHAT IS A CATEGORY A CLIENT/srai2/\nCute pets.\n/srai/what is a chat robot/srai2/\n/srai/what is a chatterbot/srai2/\n/srai/what is a christian/srai2/\nPeople I talk to on the Internet.\nFunny people.\nIce and rock.\nWhen you are waiting for a friend to finish working at a computer terminal, and they say 'I'll be done in a second.'

The primary design feature of AIML is minimalism. Compared with other chat robot languages, AIML is perhaps the simplest. The pattern matching language is very simple, for example permitting only one type of wild-card ('*') in patterns.  AIML is an XML language, implying that it obeys certain grammatical meta-rules. The choice of XML syntax permits integration with other tools such as XML editors. Another motivation for XML is its familiar look and feel, especially to people with HTML experience.

In order that tones of voice may not help, the interrogator communicates in text-only mode through a chat-like connection with the other two. The object of the game for the interrogator is to determine which of the other two is the man and which is the woman. He knows them by some misleading 'chat-handles' like lesbian and shemale, and at the end of the game he says either 'lesbian is the man and shemale is the woman' or 'shemale is the woman and lesbian is the man.' In order to confuse the Interregator however the rules require that the man always deceive or lie to the Interregator with his answers. The woman on the other hand must always tell the truth. Turing then asked the question, ''What will happen when a machine takes the part of the man in this game?' Will the interrogator decide wrongly as often when the game is played like this as he does when the game is played between a man and a woman?
